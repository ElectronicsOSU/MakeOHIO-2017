    <p> <font face="cambria" color="black">This group created a self-navigating robot that could maneuver any obstacle course placed in front of it. The robot was unique because it was programmed to remember the paths it had previously explored such that it would not attempt to travel a dead end path again. Therefore, it could quickly navigate mazes because of its ability to memorize paths.</font></p>

    <p> <font face="cambria" color="black">This team connected a vacuum system to a toaster box using a custom 3D printed adapter to create a chocolate-mold making vacuformer machine. The plan was to make unique chocolate designs. After discovering their system wattage was too dangerously high, the team was forced to make revisions to their original design. They configured a light dimmer switch to control the power output and were able to test the machine.</font></p>

    <p> <font face="cambria" color="black">One of the most whimsical projects from the 2016 Makeathon had to be this one. This group sought to create a fully automatic pasta maker. When completed, this device could pour water and cook noodles with a heat plate. It could even add sauce to the pasta and serve the user with just the push of a button. This project won 3rd Place overall!</font></p>

    <p> <font face="cambria" color="black">This project was awarded 1st place overall because of its direct application and incredible design. The design was a simple household glove loaded with sensors of special resistive material - when bent different ways, the resistance changes. The team programmed an Arduino to interpret the signals. At this point, the Arduino could output what letter in sign language the user was gesturing. This project has plenty of real world application because of its robust and inexpensive design!</font></p>

    <p> <font face="cambria" color="black">The goal for this team was to direct a spider robot to a desired location. Using a handheld GPS “gun”, one could lock onto a location where they would like the spider to walk toward. The team planned to use an accelerometer, distance sensors, servo motors, a GPS unit and a microcontroller, but once their motor controller burnt up, they were forced to drop from the competition.</font></p>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <p> <font face="cambria" color="black">Using K-nex, an Arduino, servo motors and an ultrasonic sensor, this team created a 3D scanner. The servo motors spun a rotating platform while an ultrasonic sensor recorded the distances from an object such as a pop can. The spinning occurred until the object was viewed by the sensor for a full 360 degrees. Afterward, the team programmed a MATLAB script to compile the data to create a 3D image of the scanned object.</font></p>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <p> <font face="cambria" color="black">Ergonomik was working to create a robotic lamp that tracks and follows the writer's hand. The goal was to add continuous tracking and self-readjustment, so that the lamp always gives as much light as possible right above the user's hand. During the event, Ergonomik built a suitable mechanical structure capable of rotation and extension and almost completed a custom tracking mechanism based on Raspberry Pi and Arduino. “It was a great experience overall!”</font></p>

    <p> <font face="cambria" color="black">This project was an innovative solution to a recently popular tech topic: autonomous vehicles. Instead of making the car itself autonomous, this group decided to make a custom fixture that could be attached to the brake and gas pedals as well as the steering wheel such that the car could be remotely controlled. The group even brought a full sized car to test it (although the wheels were raised off the ground for safety purposes). This team took home the 2nd place prize!</font></p>

    <p> <font face="cambria" color="black">Traditional hardware radios have become less popular and the software defined radio (SDR) has become mainstream when producing radio communication devices. However, this team took it upon themselves to create a SDR circuit with a twist. Their project involved a TI Launchpad with a button interface that they could use to control settings such as frequency.</font></p>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <p> <font face="cambria" color="black">The Makeathon brings a diversity of students and engineering disciplines. This project was a servo motor controlled titration device. The group used a microcontroller and light sensor to determine how much titrant to add in order to neutralize the solution. After learning more about this project, it was not surprising to find out its makers were chemical engineering students here at Ohio State.</font></p>

    <p> <font face="cambria" color="black">This project used a microcontroller and a variety of sensors to develop an vehicle that could navigate through all terrains. When turned on, it would autonomously find the strongest point of access to its connected wireless network. This machine was carefully programmed such that it could follow the shortest path that led directly to the nearest router!</font></p>
