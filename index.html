    <h2>24 hour hardware hackathon</h2>

    <h3>March 5th & 6th</h3>

   <div class="sub-heading">
    <p>
        From the same folks that brought you Makeathon 2015 and the fall OHI/O Hackathons comes this year’s best hardware event. For those who are wondering, a Makeathon is a 24-hour hardware focused hackathon where the goal is to make something new, amazing and fun with a group of friends. You don’t need to have a team before you register nor do you need any hardware experience or materials to make with. You just need to have a cool idea, be open to free food and over $1000 in prizes as well as chatting with some great companies. This year’s event will be taking place at Knowlton Hall on the weekend of March 5th-6th. We know you want to register for it. We also know you want your friends to register for it.

    <!-- TITLE -->
    <span>What is a Makeathon?</span>

    <!-- CONTENT -->
    <p style=text-align:center;>
		A Makeathon is similar to a Hackathon. Both are events where participants build awesome projects from scratch in just a few short hours. Both can be 24 or 36 hour events--we will be holding a 24 hour event. The difference between a MAKEathon and a HACKathon is that we are encouraging projects to be Hardware oriented, and therefore physically <i>making</i> something!
        <br>

<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">

    <!-- TITLE -->
    <span>Does it have to be hardware?</span>

    <!-- CONTENT -->
    <p>
		This MAKEathon is a hardware focused event. All projects must use at least some piece of hardware--whether it is analog or embedded is up to you. Just a smartphone does not count but a smartphone app that tells a Raspberry Pi or LaunchPad to actuate a servo is fine. Embedded software for Arduinos or other microcontrollers are fine and Web APIs are certainly allowed. If you are interested in prizes, however, then the more Hardware you can incorporate, the better chances you will have at winning!
    </p>

<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">

    <!-- TITLE -->
		<span>I'm bad/inexperienced at hardware, should I even come?</span>

    <!-- CONTENT -->
    <p>
Yes! Absolutely still come. We will have mentors and experienced club members helping out so you are welcome to flag us down at any point. If you want to learn a bit more about hardware before the event, come to either Open Lab hours or a club meeting for the Electronics Club. Check our <a href=”https://electronicsosu.com/calendar.html”>calendar for events and lab hours</a>.

    <!-- TITLE -->
    <span>What if I want to also attend the IEEE Undergrad picnic?</span>

    <!-- CONTENT -->
    <p>
The IEEE Undergrad picnic is also on Saturday, April 18th. If you really want to attend the picnic, that’s fine. You will need to go to Check-in (starting at 11am) and let us know that you are going to the picnic. You are then free to go and come back to the MAKEathon. Just note that you will have missed the Kickoff and some build time. The logistic information covered at the Kickoff will also be in your packet that you get at Check-in.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">

    <!-- TITLE -->
		<span>What should I bring?</span>

    <!-- CONTENT -->
    <p>
You are encouraged to bring any tools you might need. There will be some tools available but keep in mind they will be for all teams to use. These tools include wire strippers, cutters and soldering irons. There will be an assortment of test equipment such as oscilloscopes, signal generators and multimeters available for all teams to use. You will not need to bring power strips or extension cords.
		</p>

		<p>
Bring your laptops, any specific hardware components you were planning on using as well as a breadboard or two if you have them.

<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">

    <!-- TITLE -->
		<span>Are any projects <i>not</i> allowed?</span>

    <!-- CONTENT -->
    <p>
        For safety reasons, projects that intend to interface with the 120V AC mains in any way other than direct power are discouraged. Even something as small as a relay controlling a lamp being on could be hazardous with exposed wires. For similar reasons, projects involving high voltage such as Tesla coils, jacob’s ladders, or plasma speakers are discouraged. If you are unsure if your project will be allowed, please ask!
    </p>
    <p>
        We reserve the right to shut down any projects that we deem as unsafe. We want the event to be great and electrocution is quite a downer. Please bring your own fuses if you intend on working with the mains or otherwise high voltage project. Railgun, coil gun or any other projects with weapons are banned. Projects such as an induction furnace are similarly banned for an obvious fire hazard.
    </p>

</div>



<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">

    <!-- TITLE -->
    <span>How many people can be on a team, or do I even have to join a team?</span>

    <!-- CONTENT -->
    <p>
        Teams may consist of up to 4 persons, including yourself. Team formation will occur directly after Kickoff. If you have a group of friends that you want to work with, you can get together and start making. If you know who you want to be on a team with before the event, come up with a Team name that you can all register under.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you would like to work in a group but have a cool idea, this is the time to pitch the idea to everyone and see if anyone would like to work with you. On the flip side, if you want to work in a group but don’t have an idea yet, listen to those pitching ideas and join up with some like-minded people!
    </p>
    <p>
        You are by no means to obligated to work in a group. If you want to fly solo, go for it!

    <span>How will judging and prizes work?</span>

    <!-- CONTENT -->
    <p>
Judges will be from a variety of experience will be evaluating projects. Projects will be judged using a rubric which includes creativity, technical difficulty, presentation as well as other categories. There will be larger prizes for the overall Winner as well as Runner Up but that certainly isn’t all! There will be prizes for Honorable Mentions in categories like “Best Lighting Project” or “Best Electromotive Project”. Even if your project goes up in a puff of magic smoke, you might end up winning the mention for “Best Nosedive”.

<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">

    <!-- TITLE -->
    <span>What if I don’t have hardware?</span>

    <!-- CONTENT -->
    <p>
We realize that hardware isn’t necessarily cheap and as easy to work with as a software project. Most people either have a microcontroller and a few LEDs or no hardware at all. Thanks to the generous folks at Texas Instruments, the Electronic Club has a stock of MSP430 LaunchPads that you and/or your team can borrow for the event! If you associate the MSP430 with unhappy times coding in assembly, don’t worry. Energia is a clone of the Arduino IDE (integrated development environment) and works like a charm by letting you program in C.
    </p>

    <p>
If you already have a microcontroller or microcomputer in mind but need cool peripherals and sensors to make with, we’ve also got you covered. Thanks to our sponsors, we will have various sensors, displays and gadgets available to borrow. We also have the essential components for any project including: wire, resistors, capacitors, LEDs, shift registers, and transistors. If you need any of those essentials, you can take them--no returning it necessary. You are encouraged to bring any tools you might need but there will be some tools and test equipment available during the event.
    </p>

<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">

    <!-- TITLE -->
    <span>Can I work on an ongoing project or does it have to be new?</span>

    <!-- CONTENT -->
    <p>
        The nature of events such as Hackathons or Makeathons encourages new ideas that you have only 24 hours to deliver on. For that reason, we encourage you to not work on an existing project and try something new! It’s more fun that way--trust us.
    </p>

</div>



<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">

    <!-- TITLE -->
    <span>What preparation can I do?</span>

    <!-- CONTENT -->
    <p>
        You are more than welcome to brainstorm ideas for projects before you come on Saturday. If there are some obvious components that you’ll need, you can order them and bring them to the event. Just be sure the brainstorm stays as a brainstorm until the event day.
