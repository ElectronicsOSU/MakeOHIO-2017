  <div class="col-md-4">
    <p> <font face="cambria" color="black">This group created a self-navigating robot that could maneuver any obstacle course placed in front of it. This project was unique because it was programmed to remember the paths it had previously explored so it would not attempt to travel a dead end path again. Therefore, the robot could quickly navigate mazes because of its ability to memorize paths.</font></p>

    <p> <font face="cambria" color="black">This team connected a vacuum system to a toaster box using a 3D printed adapter to create a chocolate-mold making vacuformer machine. The plan was to make custom chocolate designs. After discovering their system wattage was too dangerously high, the team was forced to make revisions to their original design. They configured a light dimmer switch to control the power output and were able to test the machine.</font></p>

    <p> <font face="cambria" color="black">The goal of this project was to create a map with an array of LEDs corresponding to major cities around the world. Using a microcontroller, the group was able to highlight where data packets were coming from on the host computer. This group expanded their project to display worldwide weather information as well. This project took the “best lighting project” prize at the showcase!</font></p>

    <p> <font face="cambria" color="black">One of the most whimsical projects from the 2016 Makeathon had to be this one. This group sought to create a fully automatic pasta maker. When completed, this device could pour water and cook noodles with a heat plate. It could even add sauce to the pasta and serve the user with just the push of a button. This project won 3rd Place overall.</font></p>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <p> <font face="cambria" color="black">This project was awarded 1st place overall because of its direct application and incredible design. The design was a simple household glove loaded with sensors of special resistive material - when bent different ways, the resistance changes. The team programmed an Arduino to interpret the signals. At this point, the Arduino could output what letter in sign language the user was gesturing. This project has plenty of real world application because of its robust and inexpensive design!</font></p>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <p> <font face="cambria" color="black">The goal for this team was to direct a spider robot to a desired location. Using a handheld GPS “gun”, one could lock onto a location where they would like the spider to walk toward. The team planned to use an accelerometer, distance sensors, servo motors, a GPS unit and a microcontroller, but once their motor controller burnt up, they were forced to drop from the competition.</font></p>

    <p> <font face="cambria" color="black">Traditional hardware radios have become less popular and the software defined radio (SDR) has become mainstream when producing radio communication devices. However, this team took it upon themselves to create a SDR circuit with a twist. Their project involved a TI Launchpad with a button interface that they could use to control settings such as frequency.</font></p>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <p> <font face="cambria" color="black">Using K-nex, an Arduino, servo motors and an ultrasonic sensor, this team created a 3D scanner. The servo motors spun the object around a rotating table while an ultrasonic sensor recorded the distances from it. This occurred until the object was viewed by the sensor for a full 360 degrees. Afterward, the team programmed a MATLAB script to compile the data and create a 3D image of the scanned object.</font></p>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <p> <font face="cambria" color="black">Ergonomik was working to create a robotic lamp that tracks and follows the writer's hand. The goal was to add continuous tracking and self-readjustment, so that the lamp always gives as much light as possible right above the user's hand. During the event, Ergonomik built a suitable mechanical structure capable of rotation and extension and almost completed a custom tracking mechanism based on Raspberry Pi and Arduino. “It was a great experience overall!”</font></p>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <p> <font face="cambria" color="black">This project was an innovative solution to a recently popular tech topic: autonomous vehicles. Instead of making the car itself autonomous, this group decided to make a small device that could be attached to the brake and gas pedals as well as the steering wheel such that the car could be remotely controlled. The group even brought a full sized car to test it (although the wheels were raised off the ground for safety purposes). Check out their video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ok_ntlTiLM">here</a>!</font></p>

    <p> <font face="cambria" color="black">The Makeathon brings a diversity of students and engineering disciplines. This project was a servo motor controlled titration device. The group used a microcontroller and light sensor to determine how much titrant to add in order to neutralize the solution. After learning more about this project, it was not surprising to find out its makers were chemical engineering students!</font></p>
